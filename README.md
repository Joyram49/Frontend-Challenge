# Coding Practice Projects

This repository contains various projects that are primarily focused on **coding challenges** and **JavaScript programming**. These projects were built to test and practice different JavaScript concepts and features, including ES6+, OOP, Asynchronous Programming, Promises, and more. Each project is a solution to a specific coding challenge and might not have a polished UI, as the primary focus is on JavaScript logic and problem-solving skills.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **[Tic Tac Toe](./tic_tac_toe)**

- **Description**: A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic game board
  - Basic game logic (win/loss/draw)
  - Event-driven programming
- **Focus Areas**:
  - JavaScript Functions
  - ES6 Syntax (e.g., arrow functions)
  - DOM Manipulation

### 2. **[Block Graph](./ts-block-graph)**

- **Description**: A project to visualize a block graph with user interactions.
- **Key Features**:
  - User-controlled graph creation
  - Data visualization using HTML/CSS/JS
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Asynchronous programming
  - DOM manipulation
  - Data structures in JavaScript

### 3. **[Recursive Partition](./ts-recursive-partition)**

- **Description**: A project demonstrating a recursive algorithm to solve partition problems.
- **Key Features**:
  - Recursive function calls
  - Backtracking
- **Focus Areas**:
  - ES6+ Features (arrow functions, destructuring)
  - Recursive algorithms

## Why These Projects?

These projects were developed with the primary goal of enhancing my understanding and skills in JavaScript. While the UI is not the focus, each project demonstrates important JavaScript concepts and practices. By solving different coding challenges, I continue to strengthen my problem-solving abilities and become more proficient in using JavaScript's advanced features.

Feel free to explore each project and see the code in action. If you want to contribute or improve the UI, your suggestions are welcome!

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS (for basic structure)
- Node.js (optional, depending on the project)
